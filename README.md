#Tooltip Previewer
Internal tool built for the AdWords editorial team so that they can preview tooltips before publishing them live.

##Usage
Enter text/HTML in the input boxes on the left and a draggable tooltip box will update dynamically as you type. (Note: stripped out the background and other things that may have been internal Google.)

##Notes
I could have minimized and uglified the CSS and JavaScript but thought it was overkill since this tool was only going to be used by a team of < 20 people and they may want to change it someday.
